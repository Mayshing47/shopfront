## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Desaturated blue (#6A99D4) to convey trust and reliability in the ecommerce experience.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F4F8), creating a clean, unobtrusive backdrop for product presentation.
- Accent color: Purple (#A278D4) for interactive elements and calls to action, adding a touch of modernity.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' sans-serif. Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif. Combining 'Poppins' (geometric, contemporary, fashionable) for headlines with 'Inter' (modern, objective, neutral) for the body creates a clean and engaging hierarchy that complements the functionality-driven ecommerce experience.
- Simple, outline-style icons for navigation and product categories.
- Clean, grid-based layout with plenty of whitespace to ensure products are the focus.
- Subtle transitions and hover effects to enhance user interaction.
